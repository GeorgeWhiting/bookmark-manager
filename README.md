## INTRODUCTION
This week we are building a bookmark manager.
Below are the user stories

## USER STORIES

```
As browser users
So that we can see our favourite pages
We want it to show a list of links on the homepage

As browser users
So we can find the links quickly
We want to see the links in descending chronological order

As browser users
So that we can save our favourite pages
We want to be able to add the site's address and title

As browser users
So that we know what the links are
We want to be able to add tags to links

As browser users
So we can find what we are looking for
We want to be able to filter links by a tag

## SQL

It means Structured Query Language

## CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete.  
They are the four basic functions of persistent storage.  

The letters map to commands from different things

Operation | SQL | HTTP
----------|-----|------
Create | INSERT | POST / PUT
Read(Retrieve) | SELECT | GET
Update(modify) | UPDATE | POST/PUT/PATCH
Delete(destroy) | DELETE | Delete

#### Create
Creates new rows in the table
Example: INSERT INTO "students" (NAME) VALUES ('a name');

- Where the column names are declared, we omit ID, because it's a value generated by SQL
- When passing strings to populate the rows, we use single quotes
- SQL reserves double quotes for table names

#### Read

Example: SELECT * FROM students;

- Asks the database to select everything from the table students


#### Update

Example: UPDATE "students" SET NAME = 'a name' WHERE ID = 1;

#### Delete

Example: DELETE FROM "students" WHERE ID = 1;
